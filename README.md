# TTA-Based Co-Design Environment

TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) is an open application-specific
instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for design and
programming of customized co-processors (typically programmable
accelerators). It is based on the energy efficient Transport Triggered
Architecture (TTA) processor template.

The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design flow from high-level
language programs down to FPGA/ASIC synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and
Verilog generation supported) and parallel program binaries.

Processor customization points include the register files, function units,
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

TCE has been developed by several researchers (and research assistants) of
Tampere University (Finland) and various other international contributors
since the early 2003.
