1.14         Unknown
====================
Usability features
------------------
- HBDEditor automatically fills new implementations with sequential opcode numbers

1.13   February 2016
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Semantics of extraBits in BEM changed: when the encoding is zero,
  the encoding size is now calculated as 0 and one more extra bit is
  needed than before to create the same encoding.
  When new bem files are generated, this one more
  extra bit is created. BEM files with the new semantic have version number
  of >= 1.2. When an older BEM file is loaded, the amount of extrabits
  is automatically converted to the new format.
  Loading a new BEM file with older version of TCE is not supported.
- Support for LLVM 3.8

Notable bugfixes
----------------
- Bus having no only one source or destination socket which has a subfield
  (trigger opcode index, register index, or immediate field) and no
  nop encoding(nop encoding done by always false guard) 
  no longer loses the index field in the instruction encoding.

1.12  September 2015
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.7

Other features and improvements
------------------------------
- Operation definitions can be now overridden one-by-one
  by redefining them in a local OSAL search path.
- Register files can be implemented using synchronous SRAMs. Included one
  RF implementation using Xilinx's BRAMs.

Notable bugfixes
----------------
- Basic block with only call may have crashed the compiler
- If converter broke with floating point immediate values
- Fixes to FMA unit implementations.
- ICDecoder sometimes generated VHDL syntax when should have generated Verilog

1.11      March 2015
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.6.
- tcecc: Support for the "address of label" extension:
  http://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/address-of-label-and-indirect-branches.html
- tcecc: Support for using SUB to flip the sign of constants in case the
  constant cannot be encoded directly.
- HDBEditor: External ports and additional parameters can be defined for RF 
  implementations.
- ProGe: RF's external ports can be now generated.
- tcecc --init-sp: force the initial stack pointer value
- ProGe: DefaultICDecoderPlugin generates better VHDL code for code coverage.
- ProGe: Simulating processor can now generate bus trace variant that excludes
  all locked states. The new variant is enabled when the regular bus trace is 
  enabled in the DefaultICDecoderPlugin.
- MachInfo prints bindings between ADF ports and OSAL operations' operands 
  in the function unit table.
- Clustered TTA mode compilation dropped when using LLVM 3.6.

Other features and improvements
------------------------------
- TestOsal: test context bitwidth attribute has been removed, since Operands
  know their own width. Also, values that are printed in hex format are printed
  using Operand's whole width, including leading zeroes.
- osed: Operand type can be set to Bool.
- ProGe: Generated HDL output files now have registers in deterministic order.
- Improved code coverage for default ic decoder plugin.
- Added verilog implementation to output global lock trace.
- The way SimValue stores values has been changed from little-endian to 
  big-endian convention. This doesn't affect the way how SimValue should be 
  used.
- Transfer of immediate 1 into boolean register no longer uses
  long immediate when it's not needed.
- Better descriptions on some OSAL operations.
- Added helper script generatebustrace.sh under tools/scripts/ that generates 
  bustrace from given ADF and TPEF. 
- tcecc: More user friendly error messages for several failures caused by
  unsupported ADFs.

Notable bugfixes
----------------
- Fixed ProGe not generating valid verilog code for core with IUs.
- Fixed PIG failure if ADF had 2+ IUs one having size of one and others size 
  of one plus.
- SystemC simulation hook crash fixes.
- Fixes to FMA unit implementations.

Usability features
------------------
- ttasim: register values are always printed in hex format for the whole width.
- buildopset: use LDFLAGS environment variable to fix linking in 3rd party libs.

1.10  September 2014
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.5.
- machinfo: a tool for automatically printing out documentation of
  the designed ADF in LaTeX.

Other features and improvements
------------------------------
- Compilation times improved.
- Functions marked as 'noinline' are not removed from the final program
  even though the program itself does not refer to them.
- Template Slots can be edited in ProDe's Intruction Templates-dialog.
- Added select operation that can be used for select(?) operator
  instead of conditional moves.
- Added patterns which can do select(?) operator without conditional moves
  or select operations with series of ors ands etc.
- Better error message when trying to compile to adf with broken port bindings.
- Build fixes for latest Mac OSX versions.
- Support for calling custom operations to be executed in any FU with given
  addressspace (e.g. _TCEAS_LDW("#1", addr, result) where 1 is the address
  space numeric identifier), or _TCEAS_LDW("data" where data is the name
  of the address space.
- SLEEP operation that locks the core until an external signal has been
  asserted. 
- Always false guard can be used for encoding NOPs, potentially saving
  bits in source and destination fields.
- Processor may not have ldq and ldh instructions and compiler
  can then compile code which does not load 8/16 bit values.
  Previously these operations were needed even when not used.
- C++11 compiling mode can be manually enabled by giving --enable-cxx11 for the
  configure script. The mode is always enabled if LLVM version is 3.5 or higher.
- Default ic decoder plugin can print a separate global lock trace.
- Fixed issues spotted by compiling TCE using Clang++ 3.5.
- Added a SLEEP operation to the base operation set.
- tcecc no longer asserts/breaks if LDQ/STQ or LDH/STH is missing.
  It, however, cannot emulate these, so only code which
  does not load/store 8/16-bit values will compile if these are missing.
- tcecc: Lacking some immediate width no longer force one register to be
  wasted for regcopyadder.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- Generation of conversions between half float and integers automatically.

Usability features
------------------
- ProDe: Bus-socket -connection can be edited with single click in the
  Edit Connections mode.
- ProDe: When unit details are not printed, the unit label is printed
  with a larger font for readability. The unit details toggle button is
  now added by default to the toolbar.
- ProDe: The units are now rounded in case they are function units,
  "more rounded" in case of a control unit, rectangles in case
  of register files, and trapezoids in case of immediate units.
  Also coloured: FU blue, LSU green, CU purple, IMMU orange, RF yellow.
- ProDe: In the non-unit-details mode only the unit's name is printed.
  This enables making the unit visualization (and thus the whole processor
  visualization) smaller.
- ProDe: Wider ports, sockets and buses look wider, narrower look narrower.
- ProDe: Units, ports and buses are closer to each others in the main view.
- tcecc: More user friendly error printouts when lacking immediate 
  capabilities or when running out of imem.

Notable bugfixes
----------------
- Fix PIG and ProGe when generating bits or RTL for a machine with a bus 
  (slot) that does not have any connections.
- Having volatile variables could have caused broken code being generated.
- Compiler sometimes refused to schedule to processors with relatively
  sparse connectivity but no need for register copies.
- Wrong number of parameters in osed dags might now have reasonable error
  message instead of crash.
- Boolean return values no longer cause compiler to fail.
- PIG generates initalization data also for variables initialized to zero.
- ProGe: Reset also immediate unit control signals.

1.9     January 2014
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.4.
- OSAL Operation: optional element-count and element-width attribute fields 
  added for in/out operands in operation schema. From now on operands have 
  information of their subword width and subword count.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- Support for vector comparisons with the vectorbackend.

Misc. smaller improvements
--------------------------
- Fixed the TCE sources to compile with Clang++, a lot of new warnings 
  exposed by it fixed.
- Standalone OpenCL support: More OpenCL API functions implemented; 
  support added for zero-copy buffers and reading from and writing to 
  buffers by manipulation of buffer pointers. Also reduced kernel call
  overhead.
- Explorer: HDB files which are given with -b switch are now searched under
  current working dir and default hdb search paths.
- OSEd: element width and element count of an operand are now displayed in
  operation property dialog, and these fields can also be modified for input 
  and output operands.
- all memory accesses to volatile variables now happen in original order
- TCE code base builds and works now in g++'s C++11 mode (but does not yet
  require it!) and Clang++
- Make the simulation function symbols of the compiled simulator unique 
  per compiled simulator engine instance so one can have multiple of them 
  in the same process to simulate (heterogeneous) multi-TTA setups.

Bugfixes
--------
- ldh_ldhu_ldq_ldqu_ldw_sth_stq_stw.vhdl did not react to glock properly but
  updated a new value too early to the output.
- ttasim -q now simulates half float programs correctly
- some half float comparison routine fixed
- bottom-up-scheduler caused broken schedule with function units with
  pipeline resource usage after last port usage (for example stores with
  less than store op/cycle bandwidth)
- FPU's were buggy with numbers close to 2.

1.8       June 2013
===================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.3.
- Removed the use of llvm-ld (and its copy in the TCE source tree) for linking 
  bitcode libraries. It now uses llvm-link instead. Beware: it might require your 
  Newlib bitcode libraries to be rebuilt.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- If conversion enabled in llvm side of the compiler backend.
- Post-pass operand sharing removes some unnecessary operand writes
  after instruction scheduler. Does not improve performance, only saves power.
- Computation support for half-precision floats.
- The trigger operand can be now changed on the fly for commutative
  operations in case the schedule benefits from it.

Misc. smaller improvements
--------------------------
- Some ALU vhdl implementations in default HDB optimized to be smaller.
- Instruction decoder optimized to be smaller and faster.
- Added shl1add and shl2add operations for faster array indexing calculations
  into base operation set and some ALU implementations.
- Estimator can print out info of the found and unfound cost data
  with -v (thanks to Jani Boutellier).
- Fixed some issues when using libtce through a dlopen (icd loader or some other
  "plugin interface"). When TCE loaded the operation behavior descriptions as
  plugins, not all symbols of libtce they needed were found. Now tries to link
  the OPBs against libtce whenever possible to mark the dependency.
- generatebits: -v (verbose) parameter now prints amount of full instruction
  NOPs and amounts of consecutive 2, 3 and 4+ full instruction NOP groups
- Support for Boost versions up to 1.53.0 (1.42.0 is the oldest
  tested version).

Misc. changes
------------
- -lcpp parameter needed when compiling/linking c++ programs.
- tcecc: --emit-llvm not the default anymore
- tcecc: --sequential-schedule now passes -O0 to the llvmtce only to
  enable aggressive LLVM optimization combined with a sequential
  schedule.

Hardware Database Additions
---------------------------
- 2-wide SIMD units for half floats

Usability features
------------------
- HDBEditor: Double-clicking some lists in the "Add Implementation"-dialog
  now opens editing the list item. (no need to press the "edit"-button)
- ProDe: User can add guards for all indices of a register file at once in the
  "Register File Guard"-dialog
- ProDe: Multiselection and deletion enabled for register file guards in the 
  "Bus"-dialog
- ProDe: Added a UI element to assign IDs for address spaces in the
  "Address Space"-dialog
- ProDe: Ordering of register file guard list changed to be more user 
  friendly in the "Bus"-dialog
- ProDe: When .idf is saved to a file, all file paths (.hdb, .vhdl, etc.)
  pointing under the current working directory are made relative paths,
  meaning that the absolute path above current working directory is cut off.
- ProDe: When loading an IDF file, implementation files are checked if they
  exist under absolute path or current working dir. Files that are not found,
  are searched under default search paths and if a file is found from there,
  the file path is fixed to that location. User is prompted about this.
- ProDe: Cached HDB files are now monitored for changes, and they update 
  correctly to the list of FUs/RFs that can be added from HDB. 
- ProDe: When saving IDF, default save location is the directory of the ADF.
- ProDe: Automatic implementation selection added to "Processor 
  Implementation"-dialog.

Bugfixes
--------
- ProGe/PlatformIntegrator: imem_mau_pkg.vhdl is now prepended with top
  level entity name like the actual package. (bug: #1063667)

1.7     January 2013
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.2. Dropped support for LLVM 3.0.
- Initial support for half-precision floats.
- OpenCL host-tta-device mode simulation using pocl's ttasim driver.

Misc. smaller improvements
--------------------------
- GrowMachine explorer now copies the guards when it duplicates
  buses. 
- Several vector operations such as vector load/stores added to the
  base operation set.
- Added support for vectors of 8- and 16-bit numbers in the vector backend.
- tcecc now compiles big basic blocks faster.
- tcecc --analyze-instruction-patterns dumps the operation graph just
  after instruction selection. This is helpful in finding custom operation
  candidates that are automatically selectable.
- ConnectionSweeper now starts from the loosest worsening threshold
  and makes it gradually more strict. This leads to finding the
  least-connected machines first. Also the default sweep mode is
  more coarse grained: it tries to remove all connections (RF or
  bypasses) of a bus at once, not one by one.
- explore: can now list plugin parameter descriptions (-p).
- Parts of the user manual revised by Dr. Erno Salminen. Thanks to Erno
  for his contributions.
- Added a RawData data type to OSAL. This should be used as operand data type
  for all load/store/io methods which just transfer raw data which can be of
  any type.  If using some other data type, data curruption may occur when 
  calling these operations as custom operations.
- DefaultDecoderGenerator produces slightly smaller and faster decoders.
- Added optimized ALUs to the asic_130nm_1.5V database.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- min, minu, max, maxu, minf, maxf support in codegen.
  Now the compiler can use these operations automatically, if
  available in the architecture.

Usability features
------------------
- HDBEditor: Source files section of FU Implementation dialog has now 
  Move Up/Move Down-buttons for rearranging the (compilation) order
  of the files. Thanks to Antti Häyrinen for this contribution.
- ProDe: Editing processor implementation allows double clicking on the
  component lists to get to the "select component implementation" dialog,
  no need to press the select FU/IU/RF buttons anymore. 
  Also double clicking implementation in the dialog closes the dialog.
- ProDe: When editing processor implementation, pressing close button
  no longer loses all unsaved idf data. If there is unsaved data,
  it asks if the user wants to save the idf.
- ProDe: Selecting implementation for FU or RF no longer causes the RF or FU
  list to scroll to the beginning.
- Pressing Close on OsED DAG editing dialog no longer loses unsaved data,
  it saves all unsaved data.

Major bugfixes
--------------
- __attribute__((aligned)) now works for global variables.
- register to itself move as only instruction in llvm bb could cause
  tce compiler to fail.
- explorer: The -f switch to pass compiler options to exploration took only
  the first argument. Now takes the whole command line (e.g.: -f'-a -b -c').
- multiple address spaces with reduced connectivity could cause broken
  code to be generated or compiler to abort.
- Operations with more than 3 inputs could cause usage of freed memory,
  causing compiler failures
- TCEFU macros did not work correctly with memory operations,
  the operation could end up in wrong LSU.
- Major simulator memory leaks fixed. Now very long automated DS explorations
  are feasible again.
- Failed bypassing could cause compiler to fail on sparsely connected
  machines.
- signed immediate with equal amount of bits to insruction address space
  (1 too few becauses of the sign bit) could cause broken code
  (negative jump addresses) to be generated
- If long immediate template consisted of multiple slots, long immediate
  encoded instruction references were updated incorrectly to the
  instruction bit image during the image creation.
- OSAL DAGs with constants work a bit better, smaller change
  to get strange error of invalid pattern.

Misc.
-----
- Removed the deprecated schedule binary and the old scheduler configuration
  file framework. Now programs are always compiled with tcecc and all 
  compiler options are given as command line parameters.

Known problems
--------------
- If more than one read port or more than one write port of an RF
  is connected to same bus, but there are other buses which connect only
  either of those ports, loading the compiled program may fail or hang.
  Workaround: either reduce connections so that all buses connect to 
  a maximum of only one read port of any RF and one write port of any RF
  (it may still have connections to many ports in different RF's), or 
  add connections so that all buses that connect to some read port or some 
  write ports in some RF connect to  all read or write ports.
  
1.6         June 2012 
=====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.1.

  LLVM 3.0 *might* still work but is unsupported and some features
  do not work with llvm 3.0.
  Dropped support for LLVM 2.9.
- ProGe: Experimental support for Verilog and a small Verilog hardware
  database (mixed_hdl.hdb) supporting minimal.adf. Thanks to
  Vinogradov Viacheslav for contributing this!
- Support for the address_space attribute to allow using multiple
  separate memories from C code.
- Simplified C++ interface to the processor simulation engine for making it
  easier to build C++-based system simulation models.
- ADFCombiner: an explorer plugin to generate clustered-style TTA
  machines from two input ADFs.
  
Usability features
------------------
- dumptpef -m has now more user friendly output (thanks to Kalle
  Raiskila).
- OSAL files are searched also from environment variable TCE_OSAL_PATH.

Smaller features
----------------
- OSAL.hh: FU_NAME macro for accessing the name of the function
  unit the operation is executed in. The standard STREAM operations
  now use filenames FU_NAME.in and FU_NAME.out instead of the fixed
  names. This allows easier simulation of TTAs with multiple 
  I/O FUs. By Jani Boutellier from University of Oulu.
- Allow program.ll (a fully linked LLVM assembly file) as an option for
  program.bc as an input file for the DSExplorer applications.

Experimental features
---------------------
- Support for vector input to the compiler. Code is generated from 
  LLVM vector instructions by combining multiple TCE registers into vector 
  registers and mapping the incoming LLVM vector regs to them.
  Allows using wide loads (ldw2, ldw4, ldw4) and stores (stw2, stw4, stw8)
  to load and store these vectors. This can be enabled with parameter
  --vector-backend. This feature requires prededefined register file naming
  to identify the "lanes", as generated with the ADFCombiner clustered machine
  generator plugin. Works only with LLVM 3.1.
- Added experimental bottom-up-instruction scheduler. Can be enabled with
  --bottom-up-scheduler command line parameter.

Misc. code generator improvements
---------------------------------
- Immediates marked as rematerializable; This should reduce spilling as
  values that come from immediates are not spilled to stack.
- Registers can now be renamed to different RF during scheduling.
  This is however not yet used to reduce number of register-to-registe copies
  on sparsely connected machines.
- Compiler can now make floating point constant values to be used from
  immediates instead of always putting them to constant pool.
- No longer floating point aliases for 32-bit registers on llvm backend;
  The same registers now belong to both i32 and f32 register classes. 

Noteble bugfixes
----------------
- tcecc: Missing antidependence edges could cause broken schedule when
  bypasser used on partially connected machines.
- ttasim: Try to simulate machines with unconnected ports (only a warning
  is printed in such cases). 
- tcecc: some scheduling errors didn't fail gracefully
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/tce/+bug/894816
- hdb: fpu_sp_mul.vhdl didn't freeze the pipeline with glock
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/tce/+bug/942551
- Removed one broken fu architecture from hdb;
  There was no implementation for it anyway
- ttasim: In compiling mode failed to generate simulation code for
  operation with some dags.
- compatibility fix for Fedora 16's default libedit 
  (thanks to Vinogradov Viacheslav)
- tcecc: Scheduling of operations with more than 2 inputs sometimes failed.

1.5    December 2011
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Support for LLVM 3.0. 
  LLVM 2.9 might still work but is unsupported.
  Dropped support for LLVM 2.8 and older. 
- Experimental OpenCL C Embedded Profile support in offline compilation 
  mode (we call it the OpenCL "standalone mode").
- tcecc: Floating point emulation code is not included by default anymore,
  use --swfp in case you use floating points and your machine does
  not support them.
- bclib: added a Light Weight PRinting library. Small functions useful
  for debug printouts.
- Support for calling custom operations to be executed in specified 
  function unit (e.g. _TCEFU_ADD("ALU8", A1_Cb, A1_Cr, result2)).
  Thanks to Hervé Yviquel for the patch.
- Generalizations to the architecture description format to allow
  using the instruction scheduler for operation triggered architectures. 
  The Cell SPU is the proof of the concept architecture which can be
  scheduled for out-of-the-box with LLVM 3.0 (see tcecc-spu).    

Bugfixes
--------
- HDB: Hardware bug fix for load-store units in hibi_adapter.hdb and 
  stratixII.hdb.
  Global lock signal might cause pipelined load result to be ignored.
- tcecc: Scheduler could sometimes fail to schedule on sparsely connected 
  machines.
- OSEd: OSEd crashed when selecting an operation for which there was no 
  simulation model in an otherwise valid .opb.
- OSEd: Reload modified simulation functions from a rebuilt simulation
  function module (.opb) (Bug 179).
- OSEd: Renaming an operation might cause osed to crash.
- OSEd: Checking of operation with same name already exists was broken.
- OSEd: When new operation is created, the DAG can now be edited immediately
  without false error messages about missing outputs.
- ProDe: Bit width calculation of address spaces was incorrect if max-address
  was power of 2.
- tcecc: standard libcalls are now converted to cheaper ones again using
  the llvm -simplify-libcalls (e.g. printf("foo\n") -> puts("foo").
  This was broken due to adding -fno-libcall switch as default. Now it's
  added only while building Newlib.
- Build system: Fixed build when --as-needed is used as link flag by some of 
  the libraries.
- 1-bit global constants had invalid size calculation. This could cause
  compiler to fail to write program.
- tcedisasm: the starting address of data section initialization
  output was computed wrongly.
- generatebits: MIF data image output had a rounding error which led to
  missing data words at the end of image in case the number of words was
  not divisible with the row width.
- OSAL DAG language had broken illegal recursive dag detection, which
  resulted some legal DAG's not to be used. This happened in cases
  where same operation was used multiple times inside a dag.
- OSAL: Added check of operation DAGs which do not write to some output
  operand. Refuse to load this kind of broken DAGs.
- OSAL DAG language could not recursively use smaller patterns as
  part of bigger patterns in instruction selection.
- tcecc: fail with an error in case the compiled program uses dynamic
  stack objects (not yet supported by tcecc) instead of silently 
  producing invalid code.
- Do not save the backend plugins to disk while running the design
  space exploration. This caused disk space fillup with long explorations
  and small hard disks.
- Proxim: clicking OK on the options dialog crashed Proxim in case a simulation
  was not initialized.
- ProDe: fixed a crash when checking programmability on a machine with more 
  than 1 boolean registers/no boolean register files.
- tcecc: On some platforms an exception thrown when a symbol (usually a
  from a call to a function not linked in) crashes at LLVM/TCE library
  boundaries. Moved the exception handling closer to the call position
  to produce a graceful error message printout for this case.
- Proxim: the configuration file was not saved to the correct location in
  the user home dir.
- tcecc: fixed an issue compiling multiple source code in the same
  command line with the same basename (but with a different suffix or
  directory).

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- Introduced jump with negative guard to llvm. This makes llvm's
  BranchFolding pass to generate more sane CFGs, and should result
  in slightly better code being generated.
- Can rename registers during scheduling
- Does not save return address to stack in leaf functions.
- Alias analysis of LLVM is now exploited in DDG building to improve 
  parallelization.
- TCE instruction scheduler CFG is now generated directly from the LLVM CFG.
  The old "builder" that builds the TCE CFG from a "flat" program 
  representation can still be used with --old-builder parameter, but this 
  disables also some other new features and will be removed in the next 
  TCE release.
- A major reorganization of the phases in the compiler backend. The memory 
  consumption of the compiler should be now smaller, but compile time for 
  small programs longer. NOTE: The old scheduler configuration system is now
  deprecated (not used with the default tcecc options) and will be removed in
  the next release. 

Smaller features
----------------
- ProGe: switch -s that can be used to define a separate directory for
  files that are potentially shared between multiple TTA processors in
  the same (heterogeneous) TTA multicore design.
- ProGe and PIG: the string given with --entity-name is now used to make
  the generated VHDL entity etc. names unique to allow easier
  instantiation of multiple TTA cores in designs.
- tcecc: support for LLVM assembly files (.ll) as input. 
  Thanks to Hervé Yviquel for the patch.
- ProGe: test bench generation is now disabled by default, use '-t'
  to generate the test bench.
  Thanks to Hervé Yviquel for the patch.
- ProGe: HDL-file compilation order in Modelsim compilation script is
  now fixed. Thanks to Vinogradov Vyacheslav for the patch
- tcedisasm now outputs to filename.tpef.S by default.
- generate_cachegrind now uses line numbering and counts NOPs per
  instruction in case an assembly file is present as foobar.tpef.S.
- Generatebits prints out info about the imem usage and instruction compression
  with the verbose flag (-v).
- tcecc: added switches --bypass-distance, --bypass-distance-nodre and
  --no-kill-dead-results to control the software bypassing aggressiveness and
  the dead result elimination.
- explorer: added switch --compiler_options="XYZ" to pass XYZ to tcecc when 
  calling it from during exploration.

Usability features
------------------
- ProGe: Reasonable error message when implementation for some FU is invalid.

External interface changes
--------------------------
- OSAL.hh: removed RUNTIME_ERROR_WITH_DATA as it's a too specific helper
  for OSAL API. Let's keep it minimal and clean.

Documentation
-------------
- Documented the different "datapath connectivity levels" and 
  their support in TCE.
- Added an "Unsupported C Language Features"-section.
- Added and fixed documentation on the floating point TTA designs.
- Added some documentation about the dialog used to define operation operand
  bindings and timings to a function unit in ProDe.
- Added hints about avoiding the most common bottlenecks on TTA designs with
  the current TCE compiler.
- Added some documentation for the OpenCL support.

1.4       April 2011
====================

Notable new features
--------------------
- Support for LLVM 2.9.
  LLVM 2.7 and 2.8 unsupported but might still work, see below for known 
  problems.  We strongly recommend upgrading to LLVM 2.9.
- OpenCL Embedded compliant FPU implementations by Timo Viitanen / TUT
- Generic VHDL implementations for the basic streaming operations
  from Jani Boutellier / University of Oulu.
- ConnectionSweeper IC network exploration algorithm.
  Optimizes the IC network by sweeping the buses of the machine and 
  removing the least important connections first until a cycle count
  worsening threshold is reached. Tries to remove RF connections 
  first as they are usually more expensive than the bypass connections.
- Added --pareto_set switch to the explorer for printing pareto efficient
  configurations. Currently supports the connectivity and cycle count as
  the quality metrics.
- proge: IP-XACT support updated to version 1.5
- Added switch --print-resource-constraints to tcecc to assist in 
  deciding which resources to add to the machine to improve the
  schedule. Dumps DDGs to dot files along with dependence and
  resource constraint analysis data.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- Passes the first function parameter in register instead of stack.
- Uses negative guard more aggressively, less stupid guard xoring operations.
- Emulation pattern generation improved, can use immediates directly when
  using DAG to emulate missing operations.
- Some other minor pattern improvements leading to slightly better code
  on some situations.
- Alias analysis improvements, understands that register spills to stack
  cannot alias with other memory operations
- Software Bypasser is much more aggressive.

Optimizations
-------------
- tcecc: Decreased scheduling time.
- tcecc: Decreased memory usage.
- ttasim: Compiled simulation (-q) can correctly simulate machines with
  guard latency higher than 1. Simulating such machines no longer makes 
  the simulator revert to interpreting mode.

Smaller features
----------------
- tcecc: Reasonable error message if disk space runs out during TPEF writing.
- ttasim: Refuses to simulate a program that moves a too wide immediate to 
  a too narrow jump/PC port in the control unit. It would result in wrong
  execution as it jumps to a clipped address.
- ProDe: Scroll position is kept when zooming.
- ttasim: In case of memory access alignment error, prints the address.
- explore: the explorer can now reuse old architectures in the
  design space database (DSDB). Thus it's possible to speed up resumed
  explorations by using the DSDB from the previous exploration to
  get cycle counts from the DSDB instead of a new compile&simulation.
- Improved error handling caused by broken operation DAGs. Now sometimes
  gives reasonable error message instead of cryptic error message or crash
  when operation DAG has some error.
- tcecc: tceops.h is now included automatically, not necessary to
  include it explicitly.
- tcecc: added --emit-llvm switch for fully linked LLVM .bc output.

Bugfixes
--------
- ProDe: Shows the machine which is being edited immediately also with
  WxWidgets 2.8
- ProDe: When some editing command is cancelled, and nothing is changed, 
  the machine is not marked as modified so ProDe does not want to save it.
- ProDe: Copying FU from one machine to another no longer causes
  prode to crash. The address space of FU copied from one machine to
  another is left unset.
- ProDe: No longer asks the filename again when editing a adf file in
  current directory and saving it.
- ttasim: when the last instruction executed was a jump and the
  simulation was killed (reseted), the jump was executed in the 
  new simulation.
- ProGe: Some FUs had unnecessary 'SHIFTW' parameters in the default HDB
  causing broken top level VHDL to be generated. Fixed by Jani Boutellier of 
  University of Oulu.
- tcecc: Some missing patterns could cause internal compiler error while compiling.
- Missing operation behaviour file could cause simulator or osal tester to 
  fail. Now warning message is given and the .opp without corresponding .opb
  is ignored, if behaviour source file is found. If source file not found,
  the module is still loaded(assumes all operation executed via dag code)
- Trying to load machine which used same socket as source for multiple 
  register reads (either reads same register, or moves are guarded and
  always exclusive moves) might cause the simulation to hang.
- When a machine was fully RF connected but not fully connected
  (direct busses from all RF's to FU's and FU's to RF's, but all
  buses were not connected to all sockets) some registers were never used.
- If machine has SUBF operation but no NEGF operation, compiler could
  fail to compile code for the machine.
- Default OSEd.conf which may be broken on some machine no longer comes
  with TCE. This file is now autogenerated when OSEd is ran for first
  time, and the autogeneration should create a working one.
- ProGe: Stratix2DSP platform integrator now sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
  ALTERA_LIBRARY_PATH before calling qmegawiz as a workaround to 
  a problem where TCE was compiled against a different C++ library
  than the Quartus tools.
- handling for llvm's TRAP intrinsic was missing, and could cause
  compiler complain about missing "abort"-function and to fail.

Documentation
-------------
- Documented the use of OperationDAGs to describe operation semantics.
- Added example of using ConnectionSweeper and pareto_vis to visualize
  connectivity-wise interesting architectures.
- A tutorial on using the hardware FPUs provided by TCE.

Misc
----
- llvm-gcc support deprecated. Only Clang will work correctly with LLVM 2.9
  and TCE 1.4. llvm-gcc might still work with LLVM 2.7 and LLVM 2.8,
  but is unsupported.
- ABI change: Alignment rules for some data types changes when using
  LLVM 2.9. This means that old .o and .bc files have to be regenerated when 
  upgrading TCE from using llvm 2.7 or llvm 2.8 into llvm 2.9.

Known problems
--------------
No known problems with LLVM 2.9 and Clang. See below for the known 
problems in TCE 1.3 if you have to use an older LLVM for some reason.

1.3    November 2010
====================

Notable new features
--------------------
- Support for LLVM 2.8 (support for LLVM 2.7 retained)
- ttasim: call info (setting profile_transfer_tracking) and the instruction
  profile (ttasim setting profile_data_saving) are now saved to separate
  pure text files to speed up simulation when these traces are enabled.
- ttasim: instruction profile can be converted to cachegrind-compatible 
  traces which can be visualized with kcachegrind.
- SystemC integration: Possibility to add TTA simulation models to system
  level simulations with the ability to override the operation pipeline 
  simulation models for the function units.
- Improved the scheduling for unconnected machines through temporary
  register copies based on the maze algorithm for ASIC place & route.
  Not restricted to maximum of two copies anymore.
- Basic support for debugging info when compiled with 'tcecc -g'. 
  The source code line numbers are displayed as comments in 'tcedisasm' 
  output and ttasim's disassembly.
- Platform Integration support is improved. New integrator components
  include AvalonIntegrator which can be used to integrate TTA to a
  Altera SOPC Builder component and KoskiIntegrator which can be used
  to integrate TTA processor to Koski toolset compatible IP blocks with
  IP-XACT 1.2 component description file.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- New register assignment strategy that avoids reuse of registers to
  produce more ILP for the post-pass scheduler.
- Improved code generation for comparisons of boolean values.
- Avoids putting immediate value into register with some comparisons,
  more often passes the immediate directly to the comparison operation.

Usability features
------------------
- ProDe: when copying a load-store unit (FU), also copies the address 
  space parameter.

Bugfixes
--------
- tcecc: stdout/stderr redirection was broken for running subcommands
  and caused occasional false failures.
- tcecc: sometimes generated incorrect code when there was a jump to 
  llvm select instruction (usually c/c++ ?-operator).
- ttasim: In compiling mode value written to memory sometimes appeared
  to load operations triggered at same cycle. Those should read
  the old value from the memory.

Optimizations
-------------
- ttasim: destruction was extremely slow after simulating large
  programs due to extremely slow destructor of InstructionMemory
- tcecc: Decreased scheduling time.

Misc
----
- ttasim: removed support for simulating the experimental 'sequential
  TTA programs'. Sequential a.out programs was the intermediate representation 
  from the old (now unsupported) gcc 2.7.0 compiler frontend.

Known problems
--------------
- LLVM 2.8 has a bug which may cause incorrectly compiled programs when
  the is a comparison of (only) lowest bits of integers in the code 
  being compiled.
  A patch for this bug is included in TCE release, it should be applied
  to the LLVM source tree and LLVM recompiled and reinstalled with the patch.
  LLVM 2.7 might also be affected, but we have not seen the bug appear with
  LLVM 2.7.
- Clang has a bug related to code generation of bitfields, illegal
  code may be generated if the code contains bitfield and clang is used 
  as C frontend (which is the default). This bug appears with libmad.
  See http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8171 for the bug report.
  
1.2    June 2010
================

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.7 (dropped support for LLVM 2.6)
- Proper support for Clang. Clang now the default compiler frontend
  in tcecc.
- Preliminary support for automated platform integration. 
  First supported platform is the Stratix II DSP board.
- Added parameter --no-fp-emu to tcecc. This parameter disables 
  linking any floating point emulation code. It can be used to
  make the compiled program smaller in the case the dead code 
  elimination fails to remove unused FP code.
- Added parameter --conservative-pre-ra-scheduler which leads to 
  faster schedule with machines with low amount of registers but usually
  decreases performance with machines with lots of registers.

Bugfixes
--------
- sqrt() calls are now correctly converted to SQRTF operations
  only in case the operation is supported by the ADF, otherwise
  to emulation function calls.
- tcecc: compilation warnings and errors are now always output to
  stderr unbuffered (used to output only in case of compilation error)
- Data alignment rules of data types fixed to be same in backend
  and frontend. 
- Compiled simulation does not handle long guard latencies,
  implemented fallback to the interpreted engine when simulating 
  machines which have long guard latencies.
- Multi-bit registers can no longer be used as boolean registers by the 
  compiler; support for them was buggy and using them could cause incorrectly
  scheduled programs. Now every machine has to have at least 2 one-bit
  registers which are used for guards(predicates) and boolean values.

1.1 unreleased
==============

This version was never released as tar balls, but can be only 
checked out from the version control system.

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.6 (dropped support for LLVM 2.5)
- Sign extension operations are not required anymore.
- Program Image Generator supports MIF-format (Memory
  Initialization File) used by Altera.
- ttasim-tandem: a tool for comparing the two simulation engines
  to assist in tracking simulation bugs.
- Operation code numbering guideline changed. Operation codes should be
  numbered according to the their alphabetical order. HDBEditor and ProGe
  issue a warning message if this convention is violated.
- tcecc: added a switch for setting the llvm-gcc optimization level
- Program Image Generator supports writing binary image to vhdl package
- Program Image Generator has (experimental) support for COE image files
- a helper script 'minimize-ic' for invoking the SimpleICOptimizer
  explorer plugin
- support for using the Clang as the C frontend via 'tcecc --clang'.
  NOTE: Clang 1.0 (released with LLVM 2.6) needs to be patched with
  tools/patches/clang-1.0-tce-support.patch for the TCE support.
- Utility programs to test that OSAL behaviour definitions and HDL
  implementations of function units are equal.
  - testhdb command line tool to test FU and RF implementations in HDB
  - ttaunittester to test the FUs and RFs implementations defined in IDF
- ProDe: when copying a bus, also copy its guards
- PIG now automatically copies memory images to ${proge-output}/tb directory
  if image type is ascii and -x flag is given.

Code optimizations
------------------
- Decreased scheduling time for big programs. 
  Unfortunately compiling time increased for small programs.
- Smarter heuristics for selecting which bus and FU to use, leads to
  programs which use fever connections, allowing more of them to be
  removed.
- Eliminates some stupid register to itself moves.

Bugfixes
--------
- rand() might now return something else than 0
- Scheduler could fail on machines with different short immediate widths
  and only some busses guarded.
- Random scheduler failures when software bypassing.
- Operations with state on machines with trigger bound to operand which is
  not last operand could be scheduled incorrectly.
- SimpleICOptimizer explorer plugin could remove connections that were used,
  resulting a machine where the code does not work.
- Instruction fetcher failed to fetch correct instruction when global lock
  signal was asserted.
- Better support for selecting custom ops with DAG definition.
- Having not operation on the machine caused incorrectly compiled programs.
- Better error handling for stale .opb files.
- Boost should not warn anymore about deprecated hash_set with gcc 4.3.
- Having lots of parallelism and easily analyzable memory addresses could
  cause incorrectly compiled programs.
- ttasim -q: could fail if some result is never read.
- ttasim -q: fixed wrong simulation of instructions with predicate moves
  and the same predicate written at the same cycle
- Simulator could fail to load some programs.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Toplevel busy signal now locks the core properly.
- Compiled simulator failed to simulate custom memory writing operations
  correctly.
- FU outputs are now updated when the compiled simulation is stopped to
  make the machine state correct for inspection.
- Avoids placing data at address 0 because it is indistinguishable from NULL.
- Operand type initialized correctly in osed operand editing dialog.
- Direct memory accesses to global tables could get wrong address.
- ProDe: segments cannot be selected anymore (selects the bus always instead),
  an irritating long standing bug.
- Proxim: crashed when unable the load the program due to missing
  operation simulation models.
- Missing .opb file no longer causes ttasim to go to forever loop,
  now exits with a meaningful error message.
- LIMM write to IU works if glock is issued on the same cycle
