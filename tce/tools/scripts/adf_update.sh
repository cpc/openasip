# This script reformats adf files by replacing "max-rw" element with
# "max-writes" and adds "max-writes", "max-reads" and "type" to
# immediate-units (so that they resemble register files). Also removes
# "cycles" from immediate-units.
#
# This script illustrates how (more than one line) context dependent file 
# editing can be done with awk.
# 
# Example usage with find:
# find . -iname "*.mdf" -o -iname "*.adf" -exec adf_update.sh '{}' ';'
