# This script prints out some basic information about the simulator configuration (such as CXXFLAGS and the svn revision number...)
# and some running-times and statistics of the simulations ran.

# To profile with valgrind, use the flag --valgrind
# This outputs valgrind test data into ~/simulation-results/ fft | jpeg | Tremor

# The script runs the following simulations: jpeg and Tremor
