 * are accesible without needing C++ name demangling. These two functions
 * constitute the plugin interface which are used as an access point to the
 * definitions in an operation behavior plugin module.
 *
 * Factory function returns an instance of the newly defined behavior class. 
 * A reference to the operation the behavior belongs to is given as an 
 * argument. The function is named createOpBehavior_OPERATIONNAME(), e.g.,
 * createOpBehavior_Add4().
 *
 * Destructor function needs to be defined because delete operator can be 
 * overridden in the plugin module and the deletion of the custom operation 
 * behavior instance has to be done using the correct delete operator. The
 * instance cannot be simply deallocated using delete operator in the client's
 * code. Function takes a pointer to the object that should be deleted as an
 * argument. It's named deleteOpBehavior_OPERATIONNAME(), for example,
 * deleteOpBehavior_Add4().
 *
 * The dummy variable in the last line is to force addition of semicolon after
 * the END_OPERATION() statement in user's code because semicolon is not 
 * allowed after an "extern" block (at least with all compilers). 
 *
 * The semicolon "policy" is wanted to be consistent with all statements: 
 * the statement that starts the block (e.g., OPERATION()) does not require 
 * semicolon after it, but the block ender (e.g., END_OPERATION()) does.
