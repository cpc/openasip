/**
 * Memory Model interface provides methods for emulating memory access.
 *
 * The interface provides methods for emulating the access to data memory by 
 * operations of the target architecture such as load and store. In addition,
 * an interface is implemented for direct access to the memory storage for
 * the debugging user interfaces.
 *
 * The abstract base class Memory implements all functionality except for
 * the actual write() and read() methods which write and read a single unit 
 * to the memory storage as efficiently as possible. That is left for the 
 * derived classes to implement, as it depends on the storage data structure 
 * used, etc.
 *
 * Memory base class implements the correct ordering of loads and stores within
 * the same cycle: loads in the same cycle do not see the values of 
 * the writes in that cycle. That is, the writes are committed to the memory 
 * array at cycleAdvance() call. Derived classes may loosen this behavior
 * and let the client take care of the correct ordering of the memory
 * accesses, as is the case with the compiled simulation engine and the
 * DirectAccessMemory implementation it uses for simulating data memory.
 *
 * The Memory abstraction deals with MAUs (commonly bytes). The client can
 * access the Memory for storing writing doubles and floats in case it 
 * implements floating point memory operations. Interface for those is
 * out of the abstraction level of this interface.
