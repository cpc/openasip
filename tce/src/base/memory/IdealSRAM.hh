 * Class that models an "ideal" memory.
 *
 * An ideal memory is defined as a memory with read latency zero. 
 * The data is available at the same cycle in which the load is initiated. 
 * Also, after a store is initiated, data is written into memory as soon as
 * the clock advances.
 *
 * This implementation uses a "paged array" as the storage structure which
 * avoids unnecessary allocation while providing O(1) access time. See
 * PagedArray for more details.
