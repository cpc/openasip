/**
 * @file InstructionReferenceManager.hh
 *
 * Declaration of InstructionReferenceManager class.
 *
 * The instruction reference handles references to instructions.
 * 
 * The design consists of 3 classes:
 *
 * InstructionReferenceManager: a single high-level object. Contains the
 * external interface, maps to locate a reference to an instruction
 * based on instruction, and ways to iterate over all instruction references.
 *
 * InstructionReference: The class which is shown to a client. Encapsulates
 * a reference into a single instruction. Multiple InstructionReferences
 * may point to a single instruction and these can be freely copied etc.
 * You should not use pointers to these classes, but always copy your 
 * existing objects with copy constructor/assignment into the new one when
 * returning from functions etc.
 *
 * InstructionReferenceImpl: This is internal intermediate implementation 
 * class. It is not shown to the user. There is always exactly one
 * InstructionReferenceImpl per target instruction. 
 * If two instruction references that originally pointed to different 
 * instructions (and so had different InstructionReferenceImpl objects), 
 * these objects are automatically merged and all the internal pointers 
 * and bookkeeping updated accordingly. 
 *
 * Multiple instructionreferences typically point to InstructionReferenceImpl,
 * and instructionReferenceImpl contains pointers to all of these, so it
 * can notify them in case the instructionReferenceImpl is merged with
 * another.
