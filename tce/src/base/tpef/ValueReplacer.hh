/**
 * Abstract base class of value replacer classes.
 *
 * A value replacer class handles writing of object references into an
 * output binary stream.  An object reference is represented with a value in
 * the stream.  The order in which reference values are computed may depend
 * on the data already written into the stream, which may include other
 * references whose value is not yet available.  When an object reference
 * must be written out and its corresponding value is not yet available,
 * value replacers are used.
 *
 * E.g., If file offset to the body of the section should is written 
 *       while writing section header, FileOffsetReplacer is used
 *       to write FileOffset of the first element of the section.
 *       When file offset of the first element is known, the 
 *       FileOffsetReplacer object knows where to replace write that offset.
 *
 * Value replacers defer the writing of the actual reference values.  A
 * dummy reference value is written out in stream sequential order and later
 * replaced witht he actual value whent his becomes available.
 *
 * The ValueReplacer base class is not a pure interface: it handles all
 * bookkeeping of deferred replacements.
 *
 * Each concrete value replacer handles the writing of reference to a
 * specific object type in a specific data format.
