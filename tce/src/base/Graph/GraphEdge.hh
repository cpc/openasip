 * relation (dependency, ordering constraint) between two moves of the
 * program.
 *
 * Edges are pure carriers of information about a node dependency. They do
 * not store head and tail nodes. Edges are independent objects owned by a
 * graph. They do not store a backpointer to their parent graph. All
 * topological information about the graph is stored in ProgramGraph;
 * nothing is distributed across nodes and edges.
