 * @file hash_set.hh
 *
 * @author Pekka J‰‰skel‰inen 2005 (pjaaskel-no.spam-cs.tut.fi)
 *
 * Definition for a hash set.
 *
 * Hash set provides amortized constant time access for situations in which
 * the keys need not to be stored in sorted order. hash_set is not provided
 * by STL. It's usually provided as an STL extension. For example, SGI STL
 * implements it. This header selects the best possible implementation
 * for hash_set available in the system.
