 * @author Pekka J‰‰skel‰inen (pjaaskel-no.spam-cs.tut.fi) 2003
 * @note This file is used in compiled simulation. Keep dependencies *clean*
 *
 * This file contains definitions of base data types such as Word, HalfWord,
 * Byte. These types have fixed, machine-independent bit width. If no
 * base type of the host machine that matches the required bit width
 * is found, compilation fails. In this case, it is necessary to add
 * new cases to the type definitions for the host machine at hand.
 *
 * If the host machine does not support IEC 559 (formerly, IEEE-754)
 * floating point types as native built-in types, then the floating point
 * type definitions should be replaced by abstract data types with all the
 * operators applicable to floating-point types appropriately overloaded.
