/**
 * Models the data contained in array.
 *
 * The array space is divided into pages which are allocated on-demand,
 * that is, the first time an index in that page is accessed for a write 
 * operation. Pages are stored in a table from which they are
 * retrieved using (address / page_size) as index. The offset within the
 * selected page is given by (address % chunk_size). This should result in
 * O(1) access.
 *
 * This allows modeling large arrays without reserving the memory for the
 * array if it's not accessed. The idea behind this implementation is borrowed 
 * from common (paged) virtual memory implementations of operating systems.
 *
 * Please note that this container does not perform any checking for the
 * validity of the indices due to efficiency reasons.
