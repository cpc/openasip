 * Models a bit matrix.

 * The implementation should be quite efficient. It uses natural words of
 * the machine to store the bits to provide fast logical operations on
 * larger bit chunks at the same time. Especially functions such as fully ORing
 * and ANDing two bit matrices should be quite efficient. Checking a single
 * matrix element is couple of cycles slower than the naive implementation
 * of storing one bit per word. The main methods are inline non-virtual
 * methods for fastest possible access.
