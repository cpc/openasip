 * @file hash_map.hh
 *
 * @author Pekka J‰‰skel‰inen 2005 (pjaaskel-no.spam-cs.tut.fi)
 *
 * Definition for a hash map.
 *
 * Hash map provides amortized constant time access for situations in which
 * the keys need not to be stored in sorted order. hash_map is not provided
 * by STL. It's usually provided as an STL extension. For example, SGI STL
 * implements it. This header selects the best possible implementation
 * for hash_map available in the system.
