 * TCE plugin compilation wrapper to make plugin compilation faster:
 *
 * By including these .cc files into one .cc file, all #includes are only
 * included and compiled once. Without this wrapper all files that are
 * included in multiple .cc files are being compiled multiple times, wasting
 * compilation time.
