 * Node of the control flow graph. Each node represents one basic block.

 * in which only the first can be target of jump and only the last one (save
 * jump delay slots) can contain jumps.
 *
 * @note Instructions that contain function calls are control flow barriers
 * also. For now they split basic blocks into two, with special type of edge
 * connecting them.
