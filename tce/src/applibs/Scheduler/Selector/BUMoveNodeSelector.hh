/* If enabled, the priority list crashes with error 
   "elements in iterator range [__first, __last) do not form a heap
   with respect to the predicate __comp" when calling readyList_.pop() in 
   CriticalPathBBMoveNodeSelector::candidates().

   It's probably caused by a situation in which a node's priority changes
   during scheduling and the priority list does not notify the change before
   pop() is called and it detects a malformed heap (a parent node larger than
   a child node), or something.

   @todo This needs to be fixed at some point somehow as it might result in
         weird errors in some machines or undeterministic schedule.
