/**
 * Handles user input passing between the simulator and GUI threads in Proxim.
 *
 * This class is designed to act as an interface between two threads:
 * A GUI thread handling the user interface, and a worker thread running the
 * simulator engine. The worker thread waits for the user input
 * by listening to the 'input_' condition. When the line reader receives
 * input from the GUI thread, the worker thread is signaled about the input
 * by setting the input_ condition. If the worker thread is busy and not
 * listening to the input_ condition signal when the GUI thread signals
 * about user input, the signal is lost and the user input is ignored.
 * Therefore the user input should be disabled in the GUI when the worker
 * thread is busy. ProximLineReader requests user input and sends simulator
 * engine output to the GUI thread using SimulatorEvents and the standard
 * wxWidgets event handling system.
