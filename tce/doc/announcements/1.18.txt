TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) v1.18 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for design and
programming of customized co-processors (typically DSPs) based on
the Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA).

The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design flow from high-level
language programs down to synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog
generation supported) and parallel program binaries.

Processor customization points include the register files, function units,
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

Release Highlights
==================

- Support for LLVM 7.0.
- Added hexadecimal output to PIG.
- Added HDB with register files and a basic ALU optimized for Xilinx Series 7
  devices. Thanks to Stephan Nolting and Guillermo Payá-Vayá / IMS, Leibniz
  University Hannover for the contribution of the shifter.
