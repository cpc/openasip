----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for design and

co-design flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable
processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and parallel program
binaries. Processor customization points include the register files,
function units, supported operations, and the interconnection network.
