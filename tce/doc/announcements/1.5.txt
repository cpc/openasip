TTA-based Codesign Environment (TCE) v1.5 released
--------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
application-specific processors based on the Transport Triggered 
Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable VHDL and 
parallel program binaries. Processor customization points include the 
register files, function units, supported operations, and the 
interconnection network.

This release includes support for LLVM 3.0, experimental OpenCL C
Ebedded Profile support (in offline compilation/standalone mode),
a light weight (debug output) printing library, support for calling
custom operations in specific function units, generalizations to 
the architecture description format to allow using the instruction 
scheduler for operation triggered architectures (with a proof of 
concept for the Cell SPU), several code generator improvements and
plenty of bug fixes. See the CHANGES file for a more thorough 
change listing.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to Tomasz Czajkowski of Altera for ensuring the TCE project 
is allowed to use the VHDL wrappers for certain Altera IP blocks in 
the Platform Integrator tool. This made the TCE's Altera FPGA support more 
robust.

Many thanks to Hervé Yviquel and Vinogradov Vyacheslav who submitted their
first TCE patches to this release. Keep them coming!

Also we'd like to thank the Radio Implementation Research Team from Nokia
Research Center which funded a significant part of the work for developing 
this release. Much appreciated!
