TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.14 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for design and
programming of low power customized processors based on the Transport
Triggered Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable
co-design flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable
processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and parallel program
binaries. Processor customization points include the register files,
function units, supported operations, and the interconnection network.

Release Highlights
==================

- Support for LLVM 3.9.
- Support for wxWidgets 3.x and thus Ubuntu 16.04 which doesn't ship wxW 2.x
  anymore. Check the TROUBLESHOOTING file in case encountering problems.
- Support for variable-length local arrays and alloca, that is, dynamic
  stack objects. When using dynamic stack objects, the architecture must
  have an additional 32-bit register (total minimum of 6) as one of them
  will be used as a frame pointer in functions with dynamic stack objects.
- ProGe now can generate a simple control interface "AlmaIF" that can be
  used for control and debug access to TCE processors integrated in SoCs.
- Added source code debugging window to Proxim.
