#
# Template Makefile for unit test directories.
#
# Define following variables in your unit test Makefile before
# including this:
#
# TOP_SRCDIR          Relative path to the top level directory of source code
#                     base, i.e. the directory where 'configure' is found.
#
# One can also enter follwing variables:
#
# EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS  Extra flags which should be added to the linker
#                     command of the test. This variable is usually used for
#                     library definitions, e.g., -lxercesc.
#
# EXTRA_COMPILER_FLAGS Extra flags which should be added to the compile
#                      command of the test. This variable is usually
#                      used for include definitions.
#
# INITIALIZATION      Rules defined in this variable are executed before the
#                     rest. One can for example create a rule in which the test
#                     data is initialized. NOTE: you have to add your custom
#                     rules in our Makefile *after* including this template
#                     because make seems to run the first found rule in the
#                     file as the default rule thus only the custom rule is
#                     run in case the included rules are not found first.
#
# FINALIZATION        Rules defined in this variable are executed after the
#                     rest. One can for example create a rule in which the test
#                     data is removed. NOTE: you have to add your custom
#                     rules in our Makefile *after* including this template
#                     because make seems to run the first found rule in the
#                     file as the default rule thus only the custom rule is
#                     run in case the included rules are not found first.
#
# disable_watchdog    When set to "yes", watchdog is not used. Useful for
#                     run long benchmarks.
#
# valgrind            When set to "yes", valgrind is used to detect memory
#                     leaks from the executed test.
