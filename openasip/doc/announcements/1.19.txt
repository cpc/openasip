TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) v1.19 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) is an open application-specific
instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for design and programming of
customized co-processors (typically programmable accelerators). It is
based on the energy efficient Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA)
processor template.

The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design flow from high-level
language programs down to FPGA/ASIC synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and
Verilog generation supported) and parallel program binaries.

Processor customization points include the register files, function units,
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

This release adds support for LLVM 8 and improves the usability of the
Processor Designer tool.
