This file lists solutions to common troubles people have with 
compilation and installation of TCE.

tcecc crashes with Ubuntu 16.04
-------------------------------

This is likely due to the default installation of LLVM 3.8 used
by several Ubuntu libraries being accidentally used. It is not compatible
with the TCE patched LLVM, thus the fix is to ensure the TCE tools
use the correct version.

For example, install your LLVM to /usr/local/lib and add it to
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You might also need to create a symlink
to libLLVM-3.8.so.1 from your libLLVM-3.8.so as TCE build seems
to insist on linking to a file with that name (probably because it
finds it in the default search paths during build).

TCE build failing when linking with LLVM
-----------------------------------------

If, while doing the final linking of TCE with LLVM, you see the following
errors:

...
../../.libs/libopenasip.so: undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::MCAsmInfo'
../../.libs/libopenasip.so: undefined reference to `typeinfo for
...

This means that you have an LLVM that is not built with RTTI
info. Please consult the INSTALL file of TCE for information on
how to correctly build LLVM so it can be used from external
projects that use C++ RTTI.

configure does not find wxWidgets library
-----------------------------------------

If you are sure that you have all wxWidgets headers and libraries installed
(you can verify this by using wx-config), and configure is still unable to
find it, the problem might be caused by gcc 4.0 and strict compiler flags.

For example, when one has defined 'CXXFLAGS=-ansi -Wall -pedantic', the
configure test that test compiles a small wxWidgets test program fails
because of errors found in wxWidgets headers. A workaround to this is to
add '-Wno-long-long' to the CXXFLAGS. This makes the compiler skip errors
reported of usage of 'long long', which causes the compilation to fail.

Manuals and specification documents are not built
-------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have installed the transfig package and latex2html.

"Could not link against" error during configure
-----------------------------------------------

At least Ubuntu 14.04 (as of 2014-03-31) does not link the new Boost library
versions to standard library directories. The Boost library checks in the configure
script fail mysteriously because due to multiple (older) Boost version
confusing the installation path detection. In this case, either remove the old
versions of Boost or force the configure script to find only one version
installed to a certain location. For example:

 ./configure --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

A stack size error in Proxim's console
--------------------------------------

Tcl 8.5 has a bug with stack size detection which causes Proxim's
interpreter to not work at all with it, therefore it's not officially
supported by TCE at the moment. Although, it is possible to circumvent
this issue by changing the stack size in shell with:
  ulimit -s unlimited

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.x (or CentOS 4.x)
--------------------------------------------

This distribution does not provide majority of the libraries
required by TCE. In addition, it ships quite old gcc, 
the version 3.4.x.

In order to make compiling TCE in this system easier, we distribute
a binary package for the required libraries.

Download it for x86-64 from:

	http://tce.cs.tut.fi/lib/tce_libs-CentOS4.6-x64.tar.gz

After unpacking the archive to /opt, one should regenerate
the build scripts by going to the root of the tce sources and
executing the following command:

	/opt/tce_libs/bin/autoreconf

Then TCE build should be configured with the following command line:

CXXFLAGS=-O3 CFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --with-boost=/opt/tce_libs --with-xerces=/opt/tce_libs \
            --with-xerces=/opt/tce_libs --with-editline=/opt/tce_libs \
            --with-sqlite3=/opt/tce_libs

After this TCE should build and install with:

	make && sudo make install

If you wish to compile the libraries yourself, here is a quick howto for
x86-64 distibutions. Let's assume the install directory is /opt/tce_libs

xerces-c-2.7:
-------------
unzipped to: /home/<user>/pkg_src/xerces-c-2.7.0-src
export XERCESCROOT env before running configure:
$ export XERCESCROOT=/home/<user>/pkg_src/xerces-c-2.7.0-src
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/xerces-c-2.7.0-src
$ chmod a+x runConfigure configure
$ ./runConfigure -p linux -P /opt/tce_libs -b 64
$ gmake
$ su
# make install
# ldconfig

wxGTK-2.8.9:
------------
unzipped to /home/<user>/pkg_src/wxGTK-2.8.9
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/wxGTK-2.8.9
$ mkdir gtkbuild && cd gtkbuild
$ ../configure --prefix=/opt/tce_libs
$ make
$ su
# make install
# ldconfig

libedit:
--------
unzipped to /home/<user>/pkg_src/libedit-<version>
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/libedit-<version>
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tce_libs
$ make
$ su
# make install
# ldconfig

sqlite3:
--------
unzipped to /home/<user>/pkg_src/sqlite-3.6.4
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/sqlite-3.6.4
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tce_libs
$ make
$ su
# make install
# ldconfig

boost:
------
unzipped to /home/<user>/pkg_src/boost_1_36_0
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/boost_1_36_0
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tce_libs

llvm-2.6:
---------
unzipped to /home/<user>/pkg_src/llvm-2.6
$ cd /home/<user>/pkg_src/llvm-2.6
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=/opt/tce_libs --enable-pic

changing ENVs
-------------
export PATH=/opt/tce_libs/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/tce-libs/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

FreeBSD
-------

All the needed libraries except llvm are available on the ports collection.

Compilation and installation works the same way as in any Linux distro, but
the fact FreeBSD (at least 6.x-RELEASE) uses gcc-3.x series instead of 4.x, and
that some headers & libraries are installed in a different location than in
Ubuntu, makes the use of some configure switches neccessary:

./configure --prefix=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY                     \
            --with-tcl-headers=/usr/local/include/tcl8.4        \
            CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include                       \
            CXXFLAGS="-O3 -W -Wall -pedantic -Wno-long-long -g" \
            LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

After configure step ends, copy /usr/local/bin/libtool to the build directory
(i.e. the directory you ran configure script in) and then you are ready to
compile:

gmake && gmake install

(default system make is BSD make in FreeBSD systems, we need to use gmake
to run GNU make).

Installing prerequisite libraries without superuser priviledges
---------------------------------------------------------------

When installing as a normal user, it is likely that the development
packages of the required librariers are missing in the system and they
can be installed only by the superuser system widely.  In this case, the
solution is to download respective source packages, compile them, and
install also them in a user's directory just like the TCE itself.

In this example, it is assumed that the tce will be installed in
/share/userdir/openasip/tce-v.n where th v.n is substituted with the version
number of the TCE. First, the following packages (as tar archieves) are 
downloaded from the webpages of boost, tcl, wxWidgets, xerces, and sqlite 
projects:

boost_1_41_0.tar.gz                
tcl8.4.19-src.tar.gz
wxWidgets-2.8.10.tar.gz
xerces-c_2_8_0-x86-linux-gcc_3_4.tar.gz
sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.22.tar.gz

compiled, and installed on /share/userdir/openasip/extras in the following 
directories (directories must be created with mkdir before the
installation): 

$ ls extras/
boost  sqlite3  tcldevel  wxWidgets  xerces

For the tcl a symbolic link libtcl.so -> libtcl8.4.so must be created 
in extras/tcldevel/lib/

Next, the tce sources are obtained with bzr (bzr requires python2.4),
the TCE instructions are followed, and as instructed the 

llvm-2.6.tar
llvm-gcc-4.2-2.6.source.tar 

are downloaded and compiled. The llvm-2.6 is installed in  
/share/userdir/openasip/llvm-2.6 instead of extras/ in this example.

Naturally, the compilation of TCE requires defining the libraries explicitly.
Therefore, before TCE compilation the environment has to be set:

export PATH=/share/userdir/openasip/tce-v.n/bin:share/userdir/openasip/llvm-2.6/bin:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/userdir/openasip/llvm-2.6/lib:/share/userdir/openasip/extras/boost/lib:/share/userdir/openasip/extras/tcldevel/lib:/share/userdir/openasip/extras/wxWidgets/lib:/share/userdir/openasip/extras/xerces/lib:/share/userdir/openasip/extras/sqlite3:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export LDFLAGS="-L/share/userdir/openasip/extras/tcldevel/lib -L/share/userdir/openasip/extras/xerces/lib"

and the paths must be given also for the configure command of the TCE 
compilation:

./configure --with-boost=/share/userdir/openasip/extras/boost --with-wxwidgets=/share/userdir/openasip/extras/wxWidgets --with-tcl-headers=/share/userdir/openasip/extras/tcldevel/include --with-xerces=/share/userdir/openasip/extras/xerces --with-sqlite3=/share/userdir/openasip/extras/sqlite3 --prefix=/share/userdir/openasip/tce-v.n

Thereafter, make && make install should work fine. Remeber also to set
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH variables after the installation when you
try to run the tce for the first time in a new shell.


C++ global object constructors
------------------------------

In case your program uses C++ global objects with constructors, your
main() definition must be defined with __attribute__((noinline)). 
Otherwise your program might get corrupted stack pointer in the
beginning. This is a known issue yet to be fixed.

If you want to contribute a fix to this, ask in tce-devel for pointers as
how to implement this properly is well-known.
